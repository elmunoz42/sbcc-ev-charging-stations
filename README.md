# How Can the County of Santa Barbara's Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Data Advance the Implementation of the Zero Emission Vehicle Plan? 

## Executive Summary

This ongoing research project analyzes historical electric vehicle (EV) charging data to support the County of Santa Barbara's Zero Emission Vehicle Plan. With transportation accounting for 48% of the County's greenhouse gas emissions and an ambitious goal to reduce community-wide emissions by 50% by 2030, optimizing EV charging infrastructure is critical to achieving climate targets.
The study examines four years (2020-2024) of charging station utilization data collected from the County's PowerFlex reporting system. Two primary datasets were analyzed: a session-level dataset containing 88,919 individual charging events and a day-level dataset with 1,827 days of aggregated metrics.

### Key findings include:

- Public charging stations experience excessive idleness only 6% of the time, indicating efficient utilization
- Initial forecasting models of energy demand require refinement to accurately capture the upward trajectory in EV adoption

## Research Question

How can historical electric vehicle (EV) charging station utilization data be used to forecast future charging capacity needs and optimize charging station placement in the County of Santa Barbara to help meet the "Zero Emission Vehicle Plan" goals?

## Rationale

The County of Santa Barbara (CSB) has ambitious greenhouse gas emission goals. The following excerpt is from a document my CSB liaison at the transportation department Jerel Francisco is working on. The document is already in a public draft format and available on the [CSB's transportation department website](https://www.countyofsb.org/3218/Transportation).

### County of Santa Barbara Zero Emission Vehicle Plan (Public Draft) - May 2025 - Transportation Department

#### URL: https://cosantabarbara.app.box.com/s/uyds828nxptcrtsjbqssyiu4rpps5odr
#### Excerpt:

"The County has been a leader in climate action, taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and prepare for climate impacts. The 2030 Climate Action Plan (CAP) has a target to reduce community-wide emissions 50% by 2030 (below 2018 levels). On-road vehicle transportation accounts for 48% of the County's GHG emissionsÂ¹. As of 2022, zero emission vehicles (ZEV) make up less than 2% of all vehicles on the road in Santa Barbara County.

To meet State and local emission reduction targets, the CAP includes the following goals to reduce transportation-related emissions:

#### Table 1. 2030 Climate Action Plan Zero Emission Mobility Goals

| CAP Goal | 2030 Goal | 2045 Goal |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Increase passenger electric vehicle ownership | 25% | 90% |
| Increase commercial electric vehicle use | 15% | 75% |
| Install at least 375 publicly available electric vehicle chargers | 375 | NA |
| Decarbonize off-road equipment | 21% | 38% |
| Increase bike-mode share | 1% | 5% |

ZEV planning and implementation transects nearly all County operations and community functions, from fleet vehicles, building regulations, infrastructure, parking and energy management. It will require action from both internal County Departments and local community and municipal partners to help implement the Actions (page 31) identified in this plan."

### Hypothesis of How Data Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms Can Help CSB's Goals

Given CSB's stated goals, a number of specific questions arise:

1) If CSB is to increase the passenger electric vehicle (EV) ownership to 25%, what impact does that have on energy utilization? Especially, what kinds of spikes should we expect?

*Response strategy:* By training a forecasting model, we will be able to get a sense of the rapid oscillations and seasonal peaks and troughs we are to expect. E.g., tourist seasons, work commute rush, etc. One important consideration is that we will need to forecast the amount of total passenger cars the CSB will have by then compared to today to accurately predict the pertinent metrics for the 25% we are hoping will be EVs. In other words: If the amount of EVs today requires a charging grid with a certain capacity, how much will the future amount of EVs that we are hoping for require?

2) If CSB is to install at least 375 publicly available electric vehicle chargers, where are the best places to build new charging stations?

*Response strategy:* Once we have the forecasting model and our range of needed grid capacity, we will look at the "Sessions" data to review individual charging stations and identify capacity strain. This should allow us to make recommendations for expansion of charging infrastructure.

3) Are there ways to optimize the grid to meet more energy output demand by modifying public utilization policies?

*Response strategy:* We will review the sessions data with visualizations, coefficient matrices, and decision tree modeling and inference. This will enable a much deeper understanding of the factors that are at play and allow for effective policy recommendations. E.g., reducing the idling time allowance during peak hours from 4 to 2 hours before a penalty charge. Please note that any such policy change will need to thoroughly consider not just logistic impacts but also accessibility impact on the CSB's citizens, especially marginalized groups, as this is an imperative clearly stated in the "Zero Emission Vehicle Plan".

*Summary:* This capstone research paper will work to address these 3 items in turn. Additionally, we have already been providing CSB value in performing statistical analysis and visualizations for data that had never before been thoroughly explored. Our hope is that the timing coincides and findings from this report can actually inform CSB's "Zero Emission Vehicle Plan" official report that is being actively worked on by Jerel Francisco and his colleagues.
   
## Data Sources

CSB's charging stations are integrated with a PowerFlex reporting system with up-to-date utilization metrics. The historical charging station utilization data includes session times, idle times, and energy consumption. Jerel Francisco exported the data from January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2024 for two types of data exports:
- [Sessions](https://github.com/elmunoz42/sbcc-ev-charging-stations/blob/main/data/SB-County-County-Public-Portfolio-stations-report-01_01_20-12_31_24.csv):
      - This data has 88,919 rows and 30 columns. Each row represents a unique charging session, with information about the charging site, session duration, energy usage etc.
      - The samples include public and CSB fleet vehicle utilization. Since Jerel Francisco had particular interest in the public utilization of the resources, we filter out for public usage only early on in our analysis of this dataset.
- [Days](https://github.com/elmunoz42/sbcc-ev-charging-stations/blob/main/data/SB-County-County%20Public%20reporting%202020-01-01_2024-12-31.csv):
      - This data has 1,827 rows and 22 columns. Each row represents a day in the 4-year period with data aggregated from all charging sites with information about metric averages.

For a breakdown of all the features please review the respective feature catalogues:
- [Sessions](https://github.com/elmunoz42/sbcc-ev-charging-stations/blob/main/sessions-feature-catalogue.md)

## Methodology

### Discovery and Continuous Engagement with County of Santa Barbara Domain Expert

- Discovery session: The project began with a 1-hour discovery meeting. We discussed the CSB's objectives, plans and pain points. We went over their different data sources and additional resources we could merge into our research effort.

- Bi-weely cadence of collaboration: Since then Jerel Francisco and I have met for 1 hour every two weeks and have already had 4 meetings thus far. Some of the visualizations and statistical analysis in the Jupyter Notebooks are direct answers to questions he had about the data since it has not been previously analyzed. 

### Phase 1: Data Preparation

#### Data Cleaning

- Remove duplicate records (if any)
- Standardize date/time formats
- Convert data types as needed (e.g., string dates to datetime objects)

#### Outlier Identification and Handling

- Use statistical methods (z-scores, IQR) to identify anomalous values
- Evaluate contextual validity of outliers (e.g., unusually long sessions)
- Apply appropriate treatment (removal, capping, or flagging)


#### Missing Value Imputation

- Assess patterns of missingness in both datasets
- Apply appropriate imputation techniques based on data characteristics.

### Phase 2: Efficiency Analysis (Sessions Data)
- This analysis responds to the County's request to evaluate current infrastructure efficiency before expanding capacity. Key metrics to analyze include:

#### Idle Time Analysis

- At first, we had seen some concerning signs of excessive idle states for the charging stations. When Jerel and I reviewed the initial statistical data, we were both taken aback by the fact that the average session duration was upwards of 900 minutes. After some investigation though, we were able to identify some patterns and filter out CSB's fleet utilization. 
- Fortunately, the public charging stations only have excessive idleness 6% of the time. Nevertheless, this is encouraging further investigation and perhaps some policy changes for "peak hour" utilization of charging stations.
- The concern is that people park their cars for much longer than they need for EV charging thus reducing the availability of charging stations for those in actual need of them.

#### Utilization Pattern Analysis

- Peak usage periods vs. low-demand periods
- Geographic distribution of high/low utilization
- Correlation between station type and utilization rate

#### Charging Behavior Analysis

- Distribution of session durations
- Energy consumption patterns
- Relationship between charging duration and energy delivered

### Phase 3: Time Series Forecasting (Days Data)
A SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) model will be developed to forecast future charging demand, focusing primarily on daily energy delivered (kWh).

#### Time Series Decomposition
- Adfuller test
- Trend component
- Seasonal components (daily, weekly, monthly patterns)
- Irregular components

#### Model Development

- Parameter selection (p, d, q, P, D, Q)
- Inclusion of seasonal components
- Integration of exogenous variables:

    - EV adoption rates in Santa Barbara County
    - Economic indicators
    - Policy changes


#### Model Validation

- Cross-validation using time series split
- Error metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
- Residual analysis

#### 2030 Forecasting

- Projection of daily kWh delivered through 2030
- Confidence intervals
- Scenario analysis based on different EV adoption rates

### Expected Outcomes

#### Infrastructure Efficiency Assessment

- Quantification of current utilization rates
- Identification of optimization opportunities
- Recommendations for improved efficiency

#### Capacity Forecasting Model

- Projected daily and annual energy delivery requirements through 2030
- Estimated number of additional charging stations needed
- Geographic distribution recommendations

#### Policy Recommendations

- Evidence-based strategies to support the County's climate goals
- Prioritization framework for infrastructure investments
- Monitoring approach for ongoing performance assessment

### Alignment with Climate Action Plan Goals
This analysis directly supports the County's 2030 Climate Action Plan Zero Emission Mobility Goals by:

- Providing data-driven projections to support the 25% passenger EV ownership goal
- Identifying infrastructure needs for the 15% commercial EV use goal
- Informing strategic placement of the 375 publicly available EV chargers
- Establishing a framework for ongoing monitoring and optimization

## Results

The initial baseline forecast model fails to represent the upward trajectory of the test data. This might be improved using the SARIMAX model instead of ARIMA to account for seasonality, natural trends and other factors. Furthermore, the data might need a higher differencing value so that it is stationary, cross validation will be employed to fine tune such hyperparameters. One additional consideration, as previously discussed, besides the "natural" growth trend we will also compute the "aspirational" upward trend that is the target of the Zero Emission Vehicle Plan. So a few different models will need to be calculated and reviewed to accomplish our objectives.

## Next steps

- Investigate different values for differencing.
- Add seasonality and trends to the model.
- In my searches, a recommendation for the GARCH model was mentioned to better handle the volatility of the data.
- Investigate how outliers and data volatility might be affecting the predictions. In Fig2_C in the [data-analysis-days](https://github.com/elmunoz42/sbcc-ev-charging-stations/blob/main/data-analysis-days.ipynb) notebook there are significant outliers that need to be accounted for to improve the preditions. This process needs to be reviewed carefully though because we need to understand the importance of the outliers and the impact they have on the EV charging infrastructure.

- Forecast other features such as "Started Sessions" in the "Days" dataset since it might be more stationary.
