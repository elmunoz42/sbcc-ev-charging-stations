# Project Context

The County of Santa Barbara (CSB) has ambicious environmental goals. The following excerpt is from a document my County liason Jerel Francisco is working on within his department. The document is already in a public draft format and available on the (CSB's transportation department website)[https://www.countyofsb.org/3218/Transportation].

### Excerpt:
"The County has been a leader in climate action, taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and prepare for climate impacts. The 2030 Climate Action Plan (CAP) has a target to reduce community-wide emissions 50% by 2030 (below 2018 levels). On-road vehicle transportation account for 48% of the County's GHG emissionsÂ¹. As of 2022, zero emission vehicles (ZEV) make up less than 2% of all vehicles on the road in Santa Barbara County.

To meet State and local emission reduction targets, the CAP includes the following goals to reduce transportation-related emissions:

### Table 1. 2030 Climate Action Plan Zero Emission Mobility Goals

| CAP Goal | 2030 Goal | 2045 Goal |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Increase passenger electric vehicle ownership | 25% | 90% |
| Increase commercial electric vehicle use | 15% | 75% |
| Install at least 375 publicly available electric vehicle chargers | 375 | NA |
| Decarbonize off-road equipment | 21% | 38% |
| Increase bike-mode share | 1% | 5% |

ZEV planning and implementation transects nearly all County operations and community functions, from fleet vehicles, building regulations, infrastructure, parking and energy management. It will require action from both internal County Departments and local community and municipal partners to help implement the Actions (page 31) identified in this plan."
